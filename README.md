# Senior project mobile application "Skinsense"
Skinsense is a mobile application that utilizes machine learning to analyze facial skin conditions, particularly focusing on acne and hyperpigmentation. 
It empowers users to analyze the severity of skin problems by taking a photo or importing your picture. 
Skinsense recommends suitable skincare products to each individual's unique needs. Additionally, the application allows users to track the progress of their facial skin analysis over time.
